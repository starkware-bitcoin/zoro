# Compressed SPV proof client

A small CLI with two commands:
- Fetch a compressed proof for a Bitcoin transaction from network sources
- Verify that proof completely offline on a stateless machine (e.g., air‑gapped)

![](../../docs/img/raito_spv_client.png)

Goal: Produce a self‑sufficient proof that can be verified by a client with no prior state and no network access — suitable for air‑gapped environments or long‑term archival.

The resulting proof is written to disk in a compact binary format using [`bincode`](https://docs.rs/bincode) with bzip2 compression for optimal file size.

## Installation

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/starkware-bitcoin/raito raito-spv-client
# verify
raito-spv-client --help
```

## CLI

Global option:
- `--log-level <level>`: Logging level (`off`, `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`). Default: `info`.

Subcommands:

### fetch
Fetch all components and write a compressed proof to a file.

Required:
- `--txid <TXID>`: Transaction id to prove.
- `--proof-path <PATH>`: Path to write the proof file.

Optional (can also be provided via env):
- `--raito-rpc-url <URL>`: Raito bridge RPC base URL. Default: `https://api.raito.wtf`. Env: `RAITO_BRIDGE_RPC`.
- `--bitcoin-rpc-url <URL>`: Bitcoin node RPC URL. Env: `BITCOIN_RPC`.
- `--bitcoin-rpc-userpwd <USER:PASSWORD>`: Basic auth credentials for Bitcoin RPC. Env: `USERPWD`.
- `--verify`: Verify the proof immediately after fetching.
- `--dev`: Development mode. Uses local bridge node and skips certain cross-checks.

Example:

```bash
cargo run -p raito-spv-client -- --log-level debug fetch \
  --txid <hex_txid> \
  --proof-path ./proofs/tx_proof.bin.bz2 \
  --raito-rpc-url https://api.raito.wtf \
  --bitcoin-rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8332 \
  --bitcoin-rpc-userpwd user:pass \
  --verify
```

### verify
Read a proof from disk and verify it.

- Designed to run completely offline; no network calls
- Stateless: verification uses only the data embedded in the proof
- Suitable for air‑gapped machines and long‑term archival

Required:
- `--proof-path <PATH>`: Path to the proof file.

Optional:
- `--dev`: Development mode. Skips certain cross-checks (e.g., strict MMR height equality).

```bash
cargo run -p raito-spv-client -- verify --proof-path ./proofs/tx_proof.bin.bz2
# or with dev mode enabled
cargo run -p raito-spv-client -- verify --proof-path ./proofs/tx_proof.bin.bz2 --dev
```

Note: Implementation details of verification may evolve; the intended behavior is fully offline verification using the self‑contained proof.

## Output proof format

Proofs are written using `bincode` (binary, compact) with bzip2 compression applied for maximum file size reduction. The file contains a bzip2-compressed, serialized `CompressedSpvProof`:

**File Structure:**
- **Compression**: bzip2 with maximum compression ratio (`Compression::best()`)
- **Serialization**: `bincode` binary format for optimal space efficiency and performance
- **Extension**: Recommended `.bin.bz2` to indicate binary + bzip2 format

**Proof Contents:**
- `chain_state: ChainState`
  - Snapshot of chain height, total work, best block hash, current target, epoch start time, and previous timestamps.
- `chain_state_proof: CairoProof<Blake2sMerkleHasher>`
  - Recursive STARK proof attesting to the validity of `chain_state` and the block MMR root.
- `block_header: bitcoin::block::Header`
  - The header of the block containing the transaction.
- `block_header_proof: BlockInclusionProof`
  - Inclusion proof of `block_header` in the MMR (from `raito-spv-mmr`).
- `transaction: bitcoin::Transaction`
  - The full Bitcoin transaction being proven.
- `transaction_proof: Vec<u8>`
  - Bitcoin `PartialMerkleTree` (consensus-encoded) containing the Merkle path for the transaction within the block.

This format is not human‑readable. To deserialize programmatically:
1. Decompress using bzip2 decoder (e.g., `bzip2::read::BzDecoder`)
2. Deserialize using `bincode::deserialize()` from the decompressed bytes

The client automatically handles both compression during proof generation and decompression during verification.

## Compressed SPV proof workflow

- Batch Execution: The executor processes batches of Bitcoin block headers (e.g., 1-10,000, then 10,001-20,000) with relevant bootloader and assumevalid Cairo programs, producing traces and public/private execution inputs.
- Proof Generation: A prover (using Cairo+Stwo) creates a STARK proof that attests to the block validation logic having been correctly executed over those headers.
- Verification: The compressed proof, along with the current chain state and MMR (Merkle Mountain Range) root, is passed to an on-chain or off-chain verifier, which can trustlessly check:
  * The validity and linkage of all block headers back to genesis.
  * The target block’s inclusion in the chain (via MMR proof).
  * Sufficient cumulative difficulty/work.
  * Correct and recent timestamps as well as other consensus rules.
  * The inclusion of a target transaction in the block (via Merkle/SPV proof).

Key Properties of the Compressed SPV Proof:
- Succinctness: The resulting STARK proof and auxiliary data are much smaller than the raw block header chain or full block data itself.
- Trust-minimization: The verifying party does not need to replay block validation—only to verify the proof and inclusion paths.
- Security: The system preserves full SPV properties: valid chain, correct target block inclusion (via MMR), and transaction inclusion (via standard Merkle proof construction), and ensures adequate accumulated proof-of-work.
